                                <p class="title mb-4">Welcome to the payback round</p>
                                  <p>First up, VBC Uster. After changing up the groups, the youngsters of VBC Uster arrived in Glattfelden. After a slow start for VBC Uster, they slowly got back into their game, but could not get a hold of it and lost 3:0 against us.</p>
                                  <p>Payback time! VBC ZuZu arrived in Glattfelden on Friday 27th 2023. After such a terrible performance in December, we wanted to do great this time around. VBC ZuZu arrived with 11 players and fought for another win. It did not look good for quite a long time. We just could not manage to get a ball on the floor of our dear opponents. The returns kept on coming. We finally had to hand over the first set 25:14.</p>
                                  <p>After a switch in the second to increase our offensive strength, we forced ZuZu to change things up. We kept on going strong but finally lost with 29:27. The last set was noticably tiring and therefore we just hadn't got the strength and the mindset to keep on pushing in the third set. Sadly but deserved, VBC ZuZu went home with a 3:0 win. </p>

                                <p class="title mb-4"> Season start 2022 / 2023 report</p>
                                <p>After a couple of friendship plays in September 2022 the season can start. The first two games were won without any problems. But as always, life can never be that easy. The harder games kicked in in December against VBC Einsiedeln, VBC Oerlikon, VBC Rämi and our alltime opponent VBC ZuZu. </p>
                                <p>The game in Einsiedeln was a though one. We sadly lost in 5 sets and could not push through until the end. The game against VBC Oerlikon was also an exciting and exhausting one. After a tough fight lots of ups and downs, the game finally has been won by VBC Oerlikon.</p>
                                <p>All previous games lead us to the final game against VBC ZuZu. But this time around we stood absolutely no chance. We could not play as good as we'd normally do. Nothing worked and VBC ZuZu had great team work, chemistry and an amazing day and won 3:0 against us.</p>
                                <p>Also the game against Rämi did not go according to plan. Nevertheless, we are looking forward for a great payback round in 2023!</p>
